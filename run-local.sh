# This script is used to run the Alerts API locally, to interact with
# existing PostgreSQL and localstack containers.
#
# It runs with a combination of properties from the default spring profile (in application.yaml) and supplemented
# with the -local profile (from application-local.yml). The latter overrides some of the defaults.
#
# The environment variables here will also override values supplied in spring profile properties, specifically
# around removing the SSL connection to the database and setting the DB properties, SERVER_PORT and client credentials
# to match those used in the docker-compose files.
#

# Provide the DB connection details to local container-hosted Postgresql DB
# Match with the credentials set in docker-compose.yml
